Agentic Security Toolkit

The Agentic Security Toolkit is a simple, script-driven utility designed for generating, testing, and analyzing common web-based attack payloads. Built for learners, researchers, and ethical hackers, it helps simulate how injection payloads interact with target web applications — without using any AI dependencies.

Features

Payload Generator
Generates a comprehensive set of payloads across:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Remote Command Execution (RCE)


Payload Tester
Automatically sends generated payloads to a specified target URL and checks for basic signs of reflection or exposure.

Exportable Results
Stores all payloads and findings in structured text/JSON formats, making them easy to review or extend.

Secure Key Management
Reads configuration and API keys (if needed) securely via .env file using python-dotenv. No hardcoding of sensitive data.

Modular Design
Simple Python scripts (generate_payloads.py, test_payloads.py, etc.) make it easy to extend or integrate into larger tools or pipelines.

Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Add your target URL and secrets in .env (if applicable):

TARGET_URL=http://example.com


3. Run the toolkit:

python generate_payloads.py
python test_payloads.py


4. View your results in results.txt.
